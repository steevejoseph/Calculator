# Multi-Functional Calculator

This GUI application was built using the python package [tkinter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter). The calculator features two modes,
basic and scientific, with basic being the default mode. To change modes, simply select the 'view' tab from the top menu,
which is pictured below, and select the desired mode.
